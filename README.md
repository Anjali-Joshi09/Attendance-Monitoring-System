# Attendance-Monitoring-System
The Attendance Monitoring System Using Face Recognition is a Python-based application that automates attendance management through real-time face detection and recognition. Built with OpenCV and Tkinter, it allows administrators to register users, train the system with their images, and automatically mark attendance when a face is recognized via webcam. Attendance records are securely stored in CSV files using pandas, ensuring easy tracking and retrieval. The system reduces manual effort, prevents proxy attendance, and provides an efficient, accurate, and user-friendly solution for managing attendance in institutions or organizations.
